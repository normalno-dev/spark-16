# SPARK-16

**Simple Processor ARchitecture 16 bit**

Here I am reinventing a simle processor based on RISC and MIPS ideas, playing with rust.

My goal is to:
1. emulate a 16-bit processor with fixed 16-bits instructions and 64KB memory.
2. write assembler for the processor
3. buiold application into WebAssembly and run in a browser
4. have a fun
